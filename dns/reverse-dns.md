# Reverse DNS

{% embed url="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/" %}

A reverse DNS query can be used to resolve a given IP address into a hostname. We can use the following commands:

```sh
$ host <ip>
$ dig -x <ip>
```

The DNS pointer (`PTR`) record provides the domain name associated with an IP addresss, and is exactly the opposite of the `A` record.

#### IPv4

> While DNS A records are stored under the given domain name, DNS PTR records are stored under the IP address â€” reversed, and with ".in-addr.arpa" added. For example, the PTR record for the IP address 192.0.2.255 would be stored under "255.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa".
>
> "in-addr.arpa" has to be added because PTR records are stored within the .arpa top-level domain in the DNS. .arpa is a domain used mostly for managing network infrastructure, and it was [the first](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc881) top-level domain name defined for the Internet. (The name "arpa" dates back to the earliest days of the Internet: it takes its name from the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which created ARPANET, an important precursor to the Internet.)

Thus, we use this fact to perform the reverse DNS query:

```sh
$ dig <reverse-ip>.in-addr.arpa PTR 

# eg. for 1.2.3.4
$ dig 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa PTR 
```
